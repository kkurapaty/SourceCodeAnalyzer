# SourceCodeAnalyzer

**SourceCodeAnalyzer** is a versatile tool designed to analyze the structure and content of source code repositories across multiple languages and project types. It can be used via a command-line interface (CLI) or integrated into a graphical UI for more interactive analysis.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Recognizes and analyzes files in C#, VB.NET, C/C++, Java, Delphi, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, Python, PowerShell, HTML/XML, CSS, PHP, Ruby, Go, Rust, and more.
- **Project-Type Detection**: Automatically detects .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and Delphi project structures.
- **File and Directory Filtering**: Skips common output and dependency folders (e.g., `bin`, `obj`, `node_modules`, `.git`) and binary files (`*.dll`, `*.exe`, etc.).
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Scans file trees, counts and categorizes files, and generates solution-level summaries.
- **Progress Reporting**: Provides real-time messages and progress updates during analysis (in the UI).
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new file types and analysis rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or newer is required to build and run the tool.
- For UI usage, a compatible Windows environment is recommended.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kkurapaty/SourceCodeAnalyzer.git
cd SourceCodeAnalyzer
```

Build the core projects:

```sh
dotnet build SourceCodeAnalyzer.sln
```

### Usage

#### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

To analyze a folder via CLI:

```sh
dotnet run --project SourceCodeAnalyzer.Cli -- "<path-to-source-folder>"
```

#### Graphical User Interface (UI)

1. Launch the UI project in Visual Studio or with `dotnet run --project SourceCodeAnalyzer.UI`.
2. Use the "Browse" button to select a solution or source folder.
3. Click "Analyze" to start analysis. Progress and results will be displayed in the interface.

## Example

Analyze a typical .NET solution:

```sh
dotnet run --project SourceCodeAnalyzer.Cli -- "C:\Projects\MySolution"
```

## Excluded Files and Folders

By default, the following are excluded from analysis:
- Output and dependency folders: `bin`, `obj`, `node_modules`, `packages`, `dist`, `build`, `.vs`, `.git`
- Binary and cache files: `*.dll`, `*.exe`, `*.pdb`, `*.cache`, `*.suo`, `*.user`

## Supported File Types

The analyzer recognizes and parses comments and code for the following file types by extension:

- **C#** (`.cs`, `.csproj`)
- **VB.NET** (`.vb`)
- **C/C++** (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`)
- **Java** (`.java`)
- **Delphi** (`.pas`, `.dpr`)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (`.js`, `.ts`)
- **SQL** (`.sql`)
- **Python** (`.py`)
- **PowerShell** (`.ps1`)
- **HTML/XML** (`.html`, `.htm`, `.xaml`, `.xml`, `.razor`, `.aspx`, `.config`)
- **CSS**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, **Go**, **Rust**, **Shell Scripts**, and more

_See `SourceCodeAnalyzer.Core/Services/SourceCodeAnalyzerService.cs` for comprehensive file type coverage._
